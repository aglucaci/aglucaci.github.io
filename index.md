# About me

I completed my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics at Temple University, advised by [Sergei Pond](https://igem.temple.edu/people/person/e266d9a5b7f043109baecc3c340491f6) in the [Viral Evolution Group](http://lab.hyphy.org/), a part of the [Institute for Genomics and Evolutionary Medicine.](https://igem.temple.edu/) 

I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the Institute for Computational Biomedicine at Weill Cornell Medicine with [Christopher Mason](https://www.masonlab.net) and [Ari Melnick](https://melnicklab.org). My research focuses on the development and application of computational methods in microbiology, immuno-oncology, and the areas in which they intersect.
