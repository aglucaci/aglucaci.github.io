# About

I am a Postdoctoral Associate at Weill Cornell Medicine with (Christopher)[https://www.masonlab.net/] Mason and (Ari Melnick)[https://melnicklab.org/], applying evolutionary theory to the study of viruses and cancer.

I recently completed my PhD in Bioinformatics at Temple University, advised by [Sergei Pond](https://igem.temple.edu/people/person/e266d9a5b7f043109baecc3c340491f6) in the [Viral Evolution Group](http://lab.hyphy.org/), a part of the [Institute for Genomics and Evolutionary Medicine.](https://igem.temple.edu/) 

My research encompasses the development and validation of computational methods for understanding how natural selection shapes gene evolution.
* This includes understanding complex multi-nucleotide substitutions within molecular sequences. 
* I also have an interest in computational virology, including surveillance of the population-level selective processes that underlie the emergence of viral variants in rapidly evolving pathogens. 
* The evolution of the brain captivates me on a personal level, and my specific interest lies in exploring the evolutionary trajectory of genes that play a vital role in brain development. 

I completed my undergraduate studies at Stony Brook University, where I earned a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in Biochemistry and obtained a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Biology from New York University.

I am committed to mentoring and inspiring the next generation of scientists by sharing knowledge and expertise with aspiring researchers and fostering their passion for scientific inquiry. Myself and several other graduate students cofounded the [Bioinformatics Studio](https://tubioinfostudio.github.io), an inclusive and hands-on environment for learning, training, sharing, and most importantly doing bioinformatics.
